IniParser provides a function for parsing ini files. The following is a short
example of how to use this function.

Assuming you have an ini file in the current directory, whose name is
"planets.ini" with the following content:
=======================
[Venus]
mass=4.86900e24 kg
radius=6051.8 km
satellites=0

[Earth]
mass=5.9742e24 kg
radius=6378.1 km
satellites=1

[Mars]
radius=3397 km
mass=0.64191e24 kg
satellites=2
=======================

Now we want to know the mass of Mars and the radius of the Earth by vimscript.
First we need to parse the file by calling IniParser#Read:

 let ini_result = IniParser#Read('./planets.ini')


Then the following two lines shows the mass of Mars and the radius of the
Earth respectively:

 echo ini_result['Mars']['mass']
 echo ini_result['Earth']['radius']


Here's a little explanation:
The information of the ini file would be stored in the variable "ini_result".
"ini_result" is a dictionary, whose key names are the group names and whose
values are also dictionaries whose key names are entry names and whose values
are the values of the corresponding keys. If you don't understand it, don't
worry, use the following line to show it:

 echo ini_result


Here's the result:

 {'Earth': {'mass': '5.9742e24 kg', 'radius': '6378.1 km', 'satellites': '1'}, 'Venus': {'mass': '4.86900e24 kg', 'radius': '6051.8 km', 'satellites': '0'}, 'Mars': {'mass': '0.64191e24 kg', 'radius': '3397 km', 'satellites': '2'}}


If you're familiar with the dictionary of vimscript, you may understand now.
